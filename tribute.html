            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><strong>A detailed account of Sardar Patel's life, including his early years, education, and political career.</strong></br>
                 
                 <br><em><strong>Early Years and Education:</strong></em><br>
                 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, a small town in the state of Gujarat, India. He hailed from a humble farming family and showed early signs of leadership and determination. Despite facing financial difficulties, Patel pursued his education with dedication. He completed his primary education in Karamsad and Petlad and later moved to Nadiad for further studies. 
                 Patel displayed an independent spirit and a strong will from a young age. He initially aspired to become a lawyer, which led him to study law. In 1900, he traveled to England to further his legal education at the Middle Temple Inn, London. He excelled in his studies and completed the 36-month course in just 30 months, returning to India in 1913 as a barrister.<br>
                
                 <br><em><strong>Legal Career:</strong></em><br>
                 Upon his return to India, Vallabhbhai Patel set up his law practice in Ahmedabad. He quickly established himself as a successful and respected lawyer. Known for his sharp intellect and no-nonsense approach, Patel became a sought-after advocate. His legal acumen and eloquence in court earned him considerable respect and financial success.<br>
                
                 <br><em><strong>Entry into Politics:</strong></em><br>
                 Patel's entry into politics was marked by his involvement in the Indian independence movement. Influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence and civil disobedience, Patel became an active participant in the struggle for freedom. His first significant political role came during the Kheda Satyagraha in 1918, where he led peasants in Gujarat in a non-violent protest against unfair taxation by the British authorities.
                 Patel's leadership during the Kheda Satyagraha earned him the title of "Sardar," meaning leader. He demonstrated exceptional organizational skills, mobilizing the farmers and negotiating with the British, which resulted in the suspension of the tax collection.<br>
                
                 <br><em><strong>Role in the Indian National Congress:</strong></em><br>
                 Sardar Patel emerged as a prominent leader within the Indian National Congress, working closely with Mahatma Gandhi and other senior leaders. He played a crucial role in organizing and leading various movements, including the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922), the Salt March (1930), and the Quit India Movement (1942). His ability to galvanize support and maintain discipline among the masses made him a key figure in the struggle for independence.<br>
                
                 <br><em><strong>Unification of India:</strong></em><br>
                 One of Sardar Patel's most significant contributions was his role in the integration of princely states into the newly independent India. At the time of independence in 1947, India consisted of over 500 princely states, each with its own ruler. As the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India, Patel took on the formidable task of unifying these states into the Indian Union.
                 Through a combination of diplomacy, persuasion, and, when necessary, the use of force, Patel successfully integrated the princely states, ensuring the territorial integrity and political unity of India. His efforts prevented the fragmentation of the country and laid the foundation for a stable and united nation.</p>
